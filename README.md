# Exoplanet--Chronicles

## Exoplanet Chronicles: Space Apps Challenge 2024

This project aims to create engaging, interactive tools to educate students about exoplanets using simulations, machine learning, and data visualization. We are developing ML algorithm to help students understand how exoplanets are detected, classified, and studied.

## NASA resources:
