### 3. High-Level Project Summary
Provide a high-level summary of your project. What did you develop? How does it address the challenge? Why is it important?

### 5. Link to Project Demo
Provide a short demonstration ("demo") of your project, either in the form of a slide presentation (7-slide limit) or a video presentation (30-second limit). Upload your demo to an external site (a cloud-based hosting service or code repository, e.g. YouTube, Google Drive, GitHub, One Drive, Dropbox, etc.) and provide a publicly accessible link. The link you provide should not require a password, permission, or registration in order to access your project demo. Review the "Tips for Creating a Project Demo" section for additional details.

### 6. Link to Final Project
Share a publicly accessible link to your final project. This can be a website you created to showcase your project, a cloud-based hosting service or code repository, or platforms such as YouTube, Google Drive, GitHub, One Drive, Dropbox, etc. The link you provide should not require a password, permission, or registration in order to access your final project.

### 7. Detailed Project Description
Provide additional details about your project. Some questions to consider are:

* What exactly does it do?
* How does it work?
* What benefits does it have?
* What do you hope to achieve?
* What tools, coding languages, hardware, or software did you use to develop your project?

### 8. NASA & Space Agency Partner Data
Provide specific details about what NASA and NASA Space Apps Challenge Space Agency Partner data you used in your project, how you used it, or how it inspired your project.

You are also highly encouraged to use data or resources from the 2024 Space Apps Space Agency Partners: Australian Space Agency, Brazilian Space Agency, Canadian Space Agency, the Communications, Space & Technology Commission in Saudi Arabia, European Space Agency, Indian Space Research Organisation, Italian Space Agency, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, Mexican Space Agency, National Space Activities Commission of Argentina, National Space Science Agency of Bahrain, Paraguayan Space Agency, South African National Space Agency, Spanish Space Agency, and Turkish Space Agency.

Remember: You are welcome to use any open data in your project. However, to be eligible for a Global Award, you must use data or resources from NASA.

### 9. References
List all of the data, resources, and tools used in your project. Resources should include any code, text, and images (even if they are open source or freely available) that you used when creating your project. If you are using any copyrighted materials, make sure you have permission to use them.


### 10. Use of Artificial Intelligence
Did you utilize any Artificial Intelligence tools and software in preparing your solution? If yes, which ones and how did you use them? (The answer to this question will not impact the judging of your project.)
