### Objectives:
- **Topollo**: Set up the base repository on GitHub and create a model-to-predict/detect exoplanets.
- **Siya**: Focus on building the interactive transit method simulation and app-like website for students to visualize these bodies after they have been detected.
- **Matshidiso**: Work on integrating a quiz or game feature into the app.

- **All**: Document any data or methods youâ€™re using in the `docs/` directory so we can keep track of progress.

## Goal
* To create an interactive learning tool that educates students about exoplanets using simulations, machine learning, and data visualizations.
* Target Audience: Students ranging from elementary to high school, with engaging, accessible materials for different learning levels.

## 1. Data Collection and model creation
* Task: collect exoplanet data from NASA and other open datasets.
* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand trends, correlations, and patterns in exoplanet data.
* Identify key features, planet size, star brightness and etc.
