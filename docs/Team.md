- [Topollo Naketsana](#section-1) [1]
- [Siyabulela Sokweleti](#section-2) [2]
- [Matshidiso](#section-3) [3]

### Objectives:
- **Topollo**: Set up the base repository on GitHub and create a model-to-predict/detect exoplanets. [1]
- **Siya**: Focus on building the interactive transit method simulation and app-like website for students to visualize these bodies after they have been detected. [2]
- **Matshidiso**: Work on integrating a quiz or game feature into the app. [3]

- **All**: Document any data or methods youâ€™re using in the `docs/` directory so we can keep track of progress.
