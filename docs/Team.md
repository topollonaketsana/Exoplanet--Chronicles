[[1] - Topollo Naketsana](#section-1) 
[[2] - Siyabulela Sokweleti](#section-2) 
[[3] - Matshidiso](#section-3) 

### Objectives:
- **Topollo**: Set up the base repository on GitHub and create a model-to-predict/detect exoplanets. [1]
- **Siya**: Focus on building the interactive transit method simulation and app-like website for students to visualize these bodies after they have been detected. [2]
- **Matshidiso**: Work on integrating a quiz or game feature into the app. [3]

- **All**: Document any data or methods youâ€™re using in the `docs/` directory so we can keep track of progress.

## Goal
* To create an interactive learning tool that educates students about exoplanets using simulations, machine learning, and data visualizations.
* Target Audience: Students ranging from elementary to high school, with engaging, accessible materials for different learning levels.

#  Project Pipeline


## Section 1:
## 1. Data Collection and model creation
* Task: collect exoplanet data from NASA and other open datasets.
* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand trends, correlations, and patterns in exoplanet data.
* Identify key features, planet size, star brightness and etc.


###

## Section 2:
## 1. Simulation Development
* Task: Build the transit method simulation.
* Use data to simulate the light curves caused by planets passing in front of stars.
* Allow users to adjust interact with the app by changing (eg) planet size, orbital period etc to visualize how all these affect detection.
(Tools: Python, Streamlit, Matplotlib)


###
## Section 3:
## 1. Interactive Tool Development - Quiz/
* Task: Add an interactive quiz or game to test student's knowledge of exoplanets.
* Incorporate visual elements and feedback.
* Ensure the tool is engaging and easy to use.
(Tools: Python, Streamlit, HTML)
